Topic:
1. The Economic Exploitation of Resources in South Africa
    Investigate the impact of diamond and gold discoveries on local communities.



### Diamond and Gold:

Economical Boosts:
The finding of gold led to the creation of the **Witwatersrand Gold Mining Company** and many other mines, making South Africa richer and attracting investors.

Lots of money came in, helping to build factories and railways in Johannesburg, which made the city grow.

The gold rush created many job opportunities for people, both skilled workers and those just starting, bringing lots of different people to the area.

By 1887, the mines were producing **19,080 ounces of gold each year**, boosting the local economy and making Johannesburg an important city.

The number of people in Johannesburg grew quickly, from 3,000 to over 100,000 by 1895, leading to more shops and services.


Social Impact:
The discovery attracted many immigrants and workers, making Johannesburg a diverse place with different cultures.

Many local workers worked long hours for low pay in tough conditions, leading to unfair treatment that continued long after.

People from different places brought their cultures to Johannesburg, which made it exciting but sometimes caused conflicts between groups.

The fast growth of the city encouraged miners to form communities and support each other, even when times were hard.

Political Impact:
The gold rush made the British want to take more control of South Africa, leading to stronger colonial rules.

With all the wealth coming in, new laws were created to manage mining and land, often favoring British settlers over local people.

The harsh conditions led some local groups to resist and fight for their rights, which helped spark future movements for independence.

The wealth from gold caused tensions between British settlers and the Afrikaners, leading to the **South African War (1899-1901)**, which changed how power was shared in the region.

Environmental Impact:
Mining changed the land a lot, causing damage to the environment and polluting water sources.

The fast growth of mining led to cutting down trees and harming the soil, affecting farming and wildlife.

As Johannesburg expanded, factories created air and water pollution, which was bad for people and animals living nearby.

Focusing too much on gold mining led to problems for the environment, and it would take a long time to fix the damage done.

A. This photo shows that the trenches is a very dangerous area, it shows how soldiers barely have any space to survive and how they can't have proper hygeine, they barely even have medical equipment, one of them lost their hand and is still covered in dirt. Again this photo shows how dangererous the trenches are and the poor life conditions of the soldiers. This photo was taken in a field hospital in the trenches so it correlates to the prompt

B. This photo shows how well equipped the soldiers are, the soliders in the trenches are armed with sharp spears and fast horses, this shows how dangerous the trenches are and could cause casualties so it correlates to the prompt.

C. This photo shows the terrain of the trenches, how jagged and uneven the terrain is, the terrain shows the outcome of a battle in the trenches that caused casualties so it correlates to the prompt.

D. This writing shows a perspective of one of the soldiers in the trenches, he describes it as a place where bodies lie and rot, showing the casualties that were caused by war, so it correlates to the prompt.

E. This writing doesn't show any tragic situations or casualties caused by the trenches, only the activities trenches soldiers do everyday. So it does not correlate to the prompt.

F. This image does not show any casualties in the trenches, just soliders taking a bath, so it does not correlate to the prompt.

G. This image shows a tank in a ditch, it should be caused by a battle that made the tank fell in the hole, this was a casualty so it correlates to the prompt.


Evidence D is supported by the prompt because it has multiple instances of evidence that proves there were casualties in the trenches. Like how there were multiple dead bodies on the floor, showing the results of a battle.


Letter:

Dear My Sweet Sweet Mento, It's been a while, the trenches are horrible, the stench is overwhelming, I'm genuinely about to pass out!!!!! Everywhere I go I see rats, I have nightmares about them every night thinking they're gonna kill me 😩! I haven't showered since I got here and everyone I see is covered mud or blood 🩸, It's terrifying!!! The trenches are so uncomfortable I've never had a good nights sleep since I got here, yeah anyways pray for me.

Yours ~~only~~ truly,

Germany thought the Lusitania was a fair target because it was carrying war supplies like bullets and shells to help Britain in the war.​

B. Many people in the United States became very angry and sad after the Lusitania sank, because lots of innocent passengers were killed, so more people started to dislike Germany and support joining the war.

C. The German government said the ship was okay to attack because it was bringing war materials to their enemy, so they saw it as a war ship, not just a passenger ship.

D. When the ship was hit, it tilted to one side, so many lifeboats could not be used, and people had to jump down into lifeboats or the water, which was very scary and dangerous.​

E. Under international law, if a ship carried military cargo, like bullets and shells, it could be treated as a war target, so the Lusitania was not protected like a normal passenger ship.

9. Write a response telegram from the Mexican President accepting or declining the proposal. Outline  your reasons for doing so, & let the Germans know what problems might be if you were to accept.  

To: German Government  
From: President of Mexico

I am **sorry**, but I must say no to your plan.
If we fight the United States, there will be a big, scary war on our land and many people could get hurt.
Our country is not strong enough for a huge war, and we do not have enough weapons or soldiers.
The United States is our neighbor, and if we attack them, they might be angry forever and hurt our towns and farms.
Because of these problems, Mexico will stay out of this plan and will not join your war.





Use the following code to decipher the Zimmerman Telegram, which was sent in  January 1917 from a German official named Zimmerman to the German ambassador  to Mexico. The coded telegram was intercepted by the British & leaked to the  American press, & was partially responsible for the US joining the Great War.
