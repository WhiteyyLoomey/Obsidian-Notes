Osmosis is the diffusion of water through ==semipermeable membrane.==
%% <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Semipermeable - </span>
<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)"></span>A membrane that lets some substances through, like a solvent, but not others, such as certain solutes.
	 %%
#### How is this different from the previous definition of diffusion?
Diffusion is the movement of any type of molecule and does not require a membrane


Small molecules can pass through <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">yellow membrane.</span>, but larger molecules can not. This is why membrane is said to be SEMI-permeable, rather than just permeable to all substances.
